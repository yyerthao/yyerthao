### YER

Hello, nyob zoo. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer 


### ⚡⚡⚡ Non-Code Stuff ⚡⚡⚡:
* I love, LOVE movies (comedy, horror, suspense), 
* cooking and eating spicy foods (pho, kaopoon, Thai and Indian curry), 
* bullet point listing, and 
* being a boy mom to my precious boys. 

Life has taught me a lot but I find myself grateful for the things I have, and for the things I don't have yet.

### Yer's Philosophies:
1. Growth mindset 🌱 ALL THE WAY. It's hard to reel yourself back into loving and being patient with yourself while you grow but I am an advocate for promoting the power of a growth mindset. I aim to practice what I preach, but even I succumb to the power of a fixed mindset here and there (BUT! as an optimist, this just paves way for more lessons to be learned).
2. Be kind, always.
3. Code puns ... good for health.
4. Bad code is just code that doesn't work YET (and might need lots of rewiring).

### 🔭 Current Playground:
1. Currently learning Java with a Udemy course, YouTube Mosh tutorials, on IntelliJ.
2. Creating an app for my kids to learn as this mama is a working mama and sometimes I can't reinforce their learning during school hours.
