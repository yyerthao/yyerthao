### Salutations!!

I am Yer, pretty darn ambitious Full Stack Software Developer from the beautiful land of Minnesota. ðŸ‘‹ Prior to venturing into the tech space, I graduated from Minnesota State University, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in English Literature. I thoroughly enjoyed writing creative fiction and poetry, however I discovered a love for coding just recently and here I am.
