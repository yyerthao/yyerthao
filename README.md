### 🧐🗣🧞 Yer's Philosophies 🌞🌎💥
1. Growth mindset 🌱 ALL THE WAY. 
2. Be kind, always.
3. Code puns ... good for health.
4. Bad code is just code that doesn't work YET, keep going.

### 🔭🌈☀️ Current Playground ☕️🥅🏀
1. Currently learning Java, Angular, and Spring Boot.
2. Creating a learning app for my kids to learn as this mama is a working mama and sometimes I can't reinforce their learning in parallel to my work hours.

### ⚡⚡⚡ Non-Code Stuff ⚡⚡⚡
I LOVE:
* movies (comedy, horror, suspense), 
* cooking and eating spicy foods (pho, kaopoon, Thai and Indian curry), 
* bullet point listing, and 
* being a boy mom to my precious boys.
