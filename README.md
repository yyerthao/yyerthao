### ABOUT ME

Hello, I'm Yer! a pretty darn ambitious Full Stack Software Developer, eager to play with code in the tech space. So far, I really enjoy finding myself challenges to create visually aesthetic front end. I also enjoy and respect the power of back end code as well - still learning, always learning.

Personally, I believe anyone and everyone, can always strive to be a better version of themself each and every day. I find myself drawn to practicing and utilizing this within my code work often. (It's the CSS I'm currently being drawn back to improve on.)


### NON-CODE STUFF
* I love, LOVE movies, 
* cooking and eating spicy foods, 
* stress-cleaning (best way to deep clean a house amiright?), and 
* being a boy mom to my precious boys. 

Life has taught me a lot but I find myself grateful for the things I have, and for the things I don't have (yet).

### Yer's Philosophies
1. Growth mindset ALL THE WAY. It's hard to reel yourself back into loving and being patient with yourself while you grow but I am an advocate for promoting the power of a growth mindset. I do try to practice what I preach, but even I succumb to the power of a fixed mindset here and there (BUT! as an optimist, this just paves way for more lessons to be learned).
2. Be kind, always.
3. Code puns ... good for health.
4. Bad code is just code that doesn't work YET (and might need lots of rewriting).

Please feel free to take a look at my code from the beginning of my time on Github to most current.
